    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will attempt an implementation of (a *machine-learning-flavoured* version of) the *Hubel & Wiesel* model of cortical networks. The model is a simplified (and, today we know, not entirely realistic) model of the primary visual cortex of the mammalian brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the model, the cortex is composed by sets of *simple cells* and *complex cells*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Simple cells* are sensitive to a specific orientation of the edges in the visual field.\n",
    "- *Complex cells* integrate the signal received by a set of *simple cells*.\n",
    "\n",
    "By abstracting away the anatomical details, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For *simple cells*: $s_{ij}(x)=x^{T}(g_{j}(w_{i}))$;\n",
    "- For *complex cells*: $c_{h,i}(x)=\\sum_{j}\\sigma_{h}(s_{ij}(x))$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is an input vector, $w_{i}$ is the weight vector of the $i$-th simple cell, $g_{j}$ is a specific realization of the $g$ transformation, $\\sigma_{h}$ is the activation function of the $h$-th complex cell, and $s_{ij}$ and $c_{h,i}$ are the output of the $i$-th simple cell and the $h$-th complex cell, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the definitions above, we expect:\n",
    "- *Simple cells* to be equivariant to transformations of the inputs, i.e. $s_{i}(gx)=P_{g}s_{i}(x)$;\n",
    "- *Complex cells* to be invariant to transformations of the inputs, i.e. $c_{h,i}(x) = c_{h,i}(gx)$,\n",

    "where $P_{g}$ is an (any!) element of the group generating the transformation $g$."
