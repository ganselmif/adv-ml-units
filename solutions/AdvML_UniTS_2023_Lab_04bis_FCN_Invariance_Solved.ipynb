    "To accomplish this goal, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the weights resulting from the training of the model described in the previous lab;\n",
    "- Learn how to extract the activations of a given layer of the model, in response to a given input;\n",
    "- Evaluate such activations on mutually-rotated versions of the same input, and compare such activations to assess their *invariance*  with respect to the transformation."
